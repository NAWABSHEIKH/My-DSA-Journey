🧩 Palindrome Partitioning --- Detailed Revision Notes 🧠 Problem
Definition

Question: Given a string s, partition it such that every substring in
the partition is a palindrome. Return all possible palindrome
partitioning combinations.

Example: Input: s = \"aabb\" Output: \[a, a, b, b\] \[a, a, bb\] \[aa,
b, b\] \[aa, bb\]

🎯 Goal We need to cut the string into multiple substrings such that
each piece is a palindrome. There can be multiple ways to do this, so we
must return all possible valid partitions.

🧩 Example Visualization

For s = \"aabb\":

Possible partitions: a \| a \| b \| b a \| a \| bb aa \| b \| b aa \| bb
Each line (\|) represents a cut, and all resulting parts are palindromes
✅.

🧱 Core Idea (Backtracking) We use backtracking, which means: Build the
solution step-by-step Whenever we find a valid part, go deeper When we
reach the end → save the path Then backtrack (undo last choice) and try
new possibilities

🧩 Function Signatures backtrack(start, s, current, result) Parameter
Meaning: start index from where to start cutting next substring s the
input string current temporary list of palindromic substrings (current
path) result final list storing all valid palindrome partitions

⚙️ Step-by-Step Execution Flow 1️⃣ Start from index 0

Try all possible substrings beginning at index 0. For \"aabb\": i
Substring Is Palindrome? Action 0 \"a\" ✅ Take it → recurse from 1 1
\"aa\" ✅ Take it → recurse from 2 2 \"aab\" ❌ Skip 3 \"aabb\" ❌ Skip

2️. Recurse deeper Every time you find a palindrome, make a recursive
call: backtrack(i + 1, s, current, result);

This means: You "cut" the string up to i Now start again from the next
index (i + 1) Explore further substrings

3️. Base Case When start == s.length(), it means we've partitioned the
entire string successfully. → So add the current list to the result.

🔍 Palindrome Checking Logic

We use two-pointer technique: boolean isPalindrome(String s, int left,
int right) { while (left \< right) { if (s.charAt(left) !=
s.charAt(right)) return false; left++; right\--; } return true; }

How it works: Compare first and last characters. If both match, move
inward. Stop when pointers cross. If no mismatch occurs → ✅ palindrome.

💻 Full Java Code with Comments import java.util.\*;

public class PalindromePartitioning {

public static void main(String\[\] args) { String s = \"aabb\";
List\<List\<String\>\> result = new ArrayList\<\>();

// Start recursion from index 0 backtrack(0, s, new ArrayList\<\>(),
result);

// Print result System.out.println(\"All Palindromic Partitions:\"); for
(List\<String\> part : result) { System.out.println(part); } }

static void backtrack(int start, String s, List\<String\> current,
List\<List\<String\>\> result) {

// ✅ Base Case: if we\'ve reached end of string, record the partition
if (start == s.length()) { result.add(new ArrayList\<\>(current)); //
make a copy return; }

// 🌀 Try all possible substrings starting from \'start\' for (int i =
start; i \< s.length(); i++) {

// Check if current substring (s\[start..i\]) is palindrome if
(isPalindrome(s, start, i)) {

// ✅ Add palindrome substring to current partition
current.add(s.substring(start, i + 1));

// 🌱 Recurse for the rest of the string backtrack(i + 1, s, current,
result);

// 🧹 Backtrack: remove last added substring to explore new cuts
current.remove(current.size() - 1); } } }

// 🔍 Helper function to check palindrome static boolean
isPalindrome(String s, int left, int right) { while (left \< right) { if
(s.charAt(left) != s.charAt(right)) return false; left++; right\--; }
return true; } }

🧭 Step-by-Step Dry Run (for \"aabb\") Level start i substring
palindrome? action 0 0 0 \"a\" ✅ add \"a\" → backtrack(1) 1 1 1 \"a\"
✅ add \"a\" → backtrack(2) 2 2 2 \"b\" ✅ add \"b\" → backtrack(3) 3 3
3 \"b\" ✅ add \"b\" → backtrack(4) 4 4 - - end add \[a, a, b, b\] 🔙
3 - - - remove \"b\" → backtrack(2) 2 2 3 \"bb\" ✅ add \"bb\" →
backtrack(4) 4 4 - - end add \[a, a, bb\]

\...and so on, eventually producing:

\[a, a, b, b\] \[a, a, bb\] \[aa, b, b\] \[aa, bb\]

🔍 Common Doubts Explained ❓ Why do we always start substring from 0?
We don't always start from 0 --- we start from the current start index
in recursion. Initially, start = 0, but later it becomes 1, 2, etc. as
recursion moves forward.

At each level: for (int i = start; i \< s.length(); i++) This loop
explores substrings starting from the current start only.

❓ Why do we pass i + 1 in recursive call? Because i marks the end of
current palindrome substring. After processing it, the next substring
must start right after it --- at i + 1.

❓ Why do we backtrack (remove last element)? Because after exploring
one valid path, we need to undo that choice and try new possibilities
for the next iteration of the loop.

❓ What is happening inside isPalindrome()? We simply compare characters
from both ends. If all pairs match until the middle → ✅ palindrome.

Example: s = \"abba\"

left=0, right=3 → a==a left=1, right=2 → b==b ✅ palindrome

💡 Trick to Recall Logic (Mnemonic) Think of "CUT + CHECK + RECURSE +
UNDO" ✂️🔍🔁♻️ Step Action ✂️ CUT Create substring from start to i 🔍
CHECK Is this substring a palindrome? 🔁 RECURSE If yes → move to next
part (i + 1) ♻️ UNDO Remove last substring → explore new cut This is the
universal pattern for backtracking + partitioning problems.

🚨 Common Mistakes Mistake Why it's wrong: Forgetting to copy current
when adding to result Causes wrong references and output corruption
Using wrong substring range Should always be s.substring(start, i + 1)
Not backtracking (remove step missing) Leads to incorrect combinations
Forgetting i + 1 in recursive call Causes infinite recursion

🧠 Time Complexity Every partition is generated and checked. Checking
palindrome = O(N) Total combinations = O(2\^N) (exponential) Overall:
O(N \* 2\^N)

🧘‍♂️ Easy Way to Remember This Program 💭 Imagine cutting a rope: Start
cutting from left. Only cut if the piece is "beautiful" (palindrome).
Keep cutting recursively. When rope ends → record the full sequence.
Undo the last cut → try cutting differently. This visual of cutting the
rope into beautiful pieces perfectly maps to the palindrome partitioning
process.

✅ What You Learned from This Problem Concept Description Backtracking
Build partial solutions and undo when needed Recursive index control
Using start and i correctly Palindrome checking Two-pointer technique
Base case logic Add result when full string is processed Substring
exploration Loop from start → s.length() Practical debugging
Understanding how substring indices shift

🧩 Bonus Tip This problem belongs to the "Partition Backtracking"
family, same as: Subset Sum Word Break Combination Sum

So once you master this pattern, 3--4 other problems become much easier.
